# Liberate-Diamond-Units
Provides easy access to units from Diamond Ore mod.

<br>

**Notes:**

<br>

This mod basically gives you easy access to the units from the Diamond Ore mod.

<br>

I made this small mod, because for me, the Diamond Ore mod did not work properly under my v7 beta (build 135) version of Mindustry, and I wanted to play with the Diamond Ore units.

<br>

I worked around most issues, but a few small problems I could not fix.

<br>

Right now, this mod provides 3 factory buildings, so that you can build (and use) most of the Diamond Ore units.

<br>

This mod can be used in the campaign, to get an extra boost of units, which are a bit stronger than most of the vanilla in-game units.

<br>

I hope you enjoy this mod, and have fun with it.
